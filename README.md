:large*blue_circle: What \_is* this?:

This is the first follow-along project from the Zero to Mastery: React course on Udemy.

---

:large_blue_circle: Setup:

I used create-react-app to build and GitHub Pages for hosting, no other dependencies needed

---

:large_blue_circle: Project Goals:

This project is meant to be an intro to React capabilities focusing on:

1. Setting up an easy to follow file structure
2. Understanding that the "dumber" our components are, the more easily they can work together or be used elsewhere
3. Where to store our state and how to pass it around efficiently
4. Gaining a better understanding of life cycle methods, specifically `componentDidMount()`
5. Using SSH key to host the project on GitHub Pages
